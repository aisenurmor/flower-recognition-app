### Flower Recognition App with Swift
 
I developed this application that predicts the flower type in the image using CoreML and Vision frameworks and [Oxford 102 Flower Dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html).

In addition, I used Alamofire, SwiftyJSON and Realm.

You can find the script that I use to convert from **.caffemodel** to **.mlmodel**, in the ConversionToMLModel folder.
